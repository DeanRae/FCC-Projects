This folder contains my solutions for the projects under the Responsive Web Design Certification from FreeCodeCamp. Altogether, the certification takes approximately 300 hours to complete. Some of the webpages may not be coded traditionally as I am following the user stories provided by the project hand out in order to pass its tests. 
Thank you for giving my code a view :)
